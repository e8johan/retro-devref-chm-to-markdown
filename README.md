# Intro

Hackish script to convert chm files to markdown.

# Use

Use ``archmage`` to convert chm files to html.

Use ``./hacking.py`` to convert html files to markdown.

# Current State

Right now ``hacking.py`` match the different types of lines, but does not 
output markdown. This will require an additional state machine, building 
tables, merging lines, etc.

# Hacking

Hack away. Hosted on github. Use pull requests and enjoy.
